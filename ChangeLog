2008-11-29 19:45  dave_messina

	* [r15049] adding more diagnostic messages to t/SeqIO/intepro.t

2008-11-28 13:24  dave_messina

	* [r15048] verbose mistakenly left on in PrimarySeq->new, which was
	  causing RootIO to be verbose about its tempfile handling after. I
	  noticed this from running SeqIO/largefasta.t. Reverting r15026,
	  wherein Heikki went after the same problem in
	  Bio::Seq::LargeLocatableSeq. Also minor cleanup in
	  t/SeqIO/largefasta.t and t/EUtilities.t

2008-11-28 10:00  dave_messina

	* [r15047] switching EUtilities.t over to BioperlTest style test
	  initialization. Was using DEBUG flag to choose whether to run
	  network tests.

2008-11-28 06:00  cjfields

	* [r15046] rearrange to avoid unnecessary warnings

2008-11-28 05:58  cjfields

	* [r15041] '::', not ':'

2008-11-28 05:33  cjfields

	* [r15040] rename (recursive tests think this is a test file)

2008-11-28 05:23  cjfields

	* [r15039] recurse into test subdirectories (means any non-test
	  filed in t/ must not end in *.t!)

	* [r15036] move into directory structure (DaveM++)

2008-11-27 16:48  dave_messina

	* [r15035] Big reorganization of SeqIO tests. Now each flavor of
	  SeqIO has its own test file (if it didn't already). Where
	  possible, test data files were renamed test.<module> e.g.
	  test.fasta so that it's easy to locate them and future code
	  refactoring is simplified.

2008-11-26 21:15  lstein

	* [r15034] squashed occasional unit variable warning

2008-11-26 21:03  cjfields

2008-11-26 18:19  cjfields

	* [r15032] Redundant; file was renamed SearchIO_blast_pull.t.

2008-11-26 18:09  cjfields

	* [r15031] [bug 2686]

	  * total gap values were wrong (now corrected in parser)

2008-11-24 05:05  cjfields

	* [r15015] [bug 2663]
	  * BLAST data checked for correct seq_inds() positions; gap
	  positions for translated sequences indicate the position just
	  before the gap
	  * the third codon position (not the first) to be precise

2008-11-24 05:02  cjfields

	* [r15014] [bug 2663]
	  * overhaul seq_inds to handle frameshifts, true gap positions
	  (the position just prior to the gap)
	  * relevant data passed onto LocatableSeqs when needed
	  * added 'frameshift' as an option to seq_inds to grab the
	  positions a frameshift likely occurs in (for TFASTX/Y)

2008-11-24 04:52  cjfields

	* [r15013] [bug 2630]

2008-11-21 16:36  lstein

	  the edge of the panel is now consistent between directional
	  (fillled arrow) and non-directional (simple box) renderings

2008-11-19 21:55  lstein

	* [r14973] [bug 2633]
	  * fasta.pm: switch out POSIX::ceil)( for sprintf() rounding
	  (off-by-one error)
	  * GenericHSP: switch out int() for sprintf() rounding. No
	  apparent effect, but int() is effectively a POSIX::floor() in
	  this case (no rounding)
	  * downside: 8 tests are failing. Need to evaluate further to
	  ensure whether the expected test results are erroneous, or
	  whether some changes need to be rolled back.

	  There's still a problem with location_from_column, the docs say
	  it will return undef for the first column (given the example) but
	  the reality is that it returns an IN-BETWEEN. This is consistent
	  with how it behaves for column 11 (given the example).
	  
	  I'll ask around about who might be depending on the current
	  behaviour.

	* [r14556] Change name to TagTree

2008-02-27 20:19  cjfields

	* [r14555] changes and additions (can't fairly implement
	  StructureValue's methods, so we'll go another route)...

2008-02-27 17:30  cjfields

	* [r14554] Add some tests, more to follow upon implementation...

2008-02-27 16:43  cjfields

	* [r14553] Remove Data::Stag cruft (use a reimplementation instead)

2008-02-27 16:41  cjfields

	* [r14552] StructuredTag - AnnotationI which uses Data::Stag for
	  structured tag representation. Just the basic implementation;
	  needs get/set tag value methods implemented.

2008-02-27 16:38  cjfields

	* [r14551] add error message for callbacks if no code reference

2008-02-26 17:18  sendu

	* [r14549] No longer makes db test if user chose not to run them

2008-02-26 17:17  sendu

	* [r14548] No longers stores code refs via Data::Dumper, avoiding
	  possible warnings

	* [r14547] bug 2458

2008-02-26 01:02  cjfields

	* [r14546] Russell's fixes

2008-02-25 09:46  heikki

	  It belongs right after RN line.

2008-02-25 08:22  heikki

	* [r14543] better roundtip when preventing line wrapping between
	  author surname and initials

2008-02-25 06:19  heikki

	* [r14540] GN changes

2008-02-23 15:10  heikki

	* [r14539] AC (accession) line now wraps if there are too many
	  accession to fit one line

2008-02-23 14:48  heikki

	* [r14538] GN (Gene Name) line parsing rewrite. Breaks backward
	  compatibility. Can now deal with >1 gene per entry and four
	  categories of names per gene. Parses old style syntax (...OR ...
	  OR ... ) into one gene name and synonyms for each gene. Docs to
	  follow.

2008-02-22 17:18  cjfields

	* [r14537] revert last commit (good catch Sendu)

2008-02-22 16:10  lstein

	* [r14536] these loaders allow gff2 and featurefile-format data to
	  be stored into gff3 databases

2008-02-22 16:09  lstein

	* [r14535] improved behavior of xy and density plots when spanning
	  regions that contained undefined scores; now just skips over
	  these regions

2008-02-22 08:09  heikki

	* [r14534] Do not print out empty KW (keyword) lines.

2008-02-21 22:09  cjfields

	  to Module::Build)

2008-02-21 20:21  cjfields

	* [r14532] TODO now works

2008-02-21 20:18  cjfields

	* [r14530] now deprecated

2008-02-21 19:48  cjfields

	* [r14529] Sequence gained a nucleotide

2008-02-21 19:48  cjfields

	  protein sequence anymore

2008-02-21 19:32  cjfields

	  when called

2008-02-20 22:38  cjfields

	* [r14523] tests for bug 2453

2008-02-20 21:51  cjfields

	* [r14522] Bug 2453; needs tests

2008-02-20 21:30  cjfields

	* [r14521] Oops! Bug 2453 again.

2008-02-20 21:13  cjfields

	* [r14520] small fix for bug 2453, but see bugzilla for reasons on
	  not closing this out

2008-02-20 17:03  cjfields

	* [r14519] bug 2452

2008-02-20 01:15  fangly

	* [r14517] New module Bio::Assembly::Tools::ContigSpectrum for
	  dealing with contig spectra obtained from metagenome assembly

2008-02-19 08:51  heikki

	* [r14516] FTId is no longer treated a part of the description of
	  an FT key but similarly to EMBL FT qualifiers. This allows for
	  100% roundtrip of the Feature Table.

2008-02-19 08:17  heikki

	* [r14515] Reindenting the code. Too many lines were slightly off
	  making reading difficult. No code changes.

2008-02-19 06:57  heikki

	* [r14514] Reindenting the code. Too many lines were slightly off
	  making reading difficult. No code changes.

2008-02-19 02:31  cjfields

	* [r14513] TODO now works

2008-02-17 11:36  heikki

	* [r14512] DOI can include

2008-02-17 11:29  heikki

	* [r14511] prevent line wrapping within author name (RA lines) and
	  withing key frase (KW lines), but allow wrapping at hyphen in a
	  title (RT lines)

2008-02-17 10:00  heikki

	* [r14510] GN line output now follows the new format. BioPerl would
	  need new objects to store all infomation so for now only the
	  official name (Name=) and synonym categories are kept. ORFNames
	  and OrderedLocusNames are treated as synonyms.

2008-02-17 09:48  heikki

	* [r14509] removed extra space chars and a full stop at the end of
	  the FT HELIX and STRAND lines. No more extra spaces at the end of
	  the line. The line length in this format is 76, not 80. Changeing
	  that solved a lot of line differences

2008-02-13 20:38  cjfields

	* [r14508] update interface documentation

2008-02-13 20:31  cjfields

	* [r14506] Rewrote RX line parsing and writing to allow DOI values
	  seen and printed out

2008-02-13 06:51  heikki

	* [r14505] PE (evidence) line was printed out between CC and DR
	  lines when it needs to be between DR and KW lines

2008-02-13 06:39  heikki

	* [r14504] Changed the swissprot parser to work regardless of the
	  end full stop character in DT lines. This solved an old problem
	  with a workaround in the swiss.t: "grabbing seq_update with old
	  SwissProt seqs fails roundtrip tests" Now make sure to print it
	  out for each DT line.

2008-02-13 05:54  heikki

	* [r14503] removed BASE COUNT line printing code. Genbank does not
	  use it any more. This should be safe, because GenPept has never
	  had it and all (most?) genbank format parsers can deal with both
	  formats

2008-02-13 05:36  heikki

	* [r14502] do not write a full stop at the end of the SOURCE line

2008-02-12 05:11  cjfields

	* [r14501] missing getter/setter added

2008-02-12 04:09  cjfields

	  WrapperBase are removed).

2008-02-11 01:41  cjfields

	* [r14498] Fix for bug 2413. Shouldn't we delegate all IO-related
	  functions to the internal IO object?

2008-02-10 04:37  cjfields

	* [r14497] test commit msgs from /usr/local/bin

	  suggestion); passes tests but needs more testing

2008-02-07 18:29  bosborne

	* [r14494] Remove dead links, don't know what should replace them,
	  unfortunately

2008-02-07 14:33  lstein

	* [r14493] Added missing documentation for memory and berkeleydb
	  adaptors.

	* [r14491] changed URL

2008-02-05 20:39  cjfields

	* [r14490] handles Bio::Taxon as well as Bio::Species now (might be
	  worth propogating to other SeqIO modules?)

2008-02-05 20:35  cjfields

	* [r14489] * small rnamotif fix
	  * significance conforms to spec (evalue, then pvalue)

	* [r14485] fixed bug in featurefile processing that inappropriately
	  grouped features with no name

2008-02-05 03:46  lstein

	* [r14484] fixed a logic error which caused undefined end
	  coordinates when creating a feature with abs=>1, a start and an
	  undefined end

2008-02-05 03:11  cjfields

	* [r14483] bug 2438; 'X' no longer completely ambiguous

	  pseudohash warnings; works now using perl 5.10.

2008-01-22 20:49  lstein

	* [r14456] new feature of -strand_arrow option allows you to
	  specify arrowheads only on first and last segment

2008-01-22 20:48  lstein

	* [r14455] fixed up the gene glyph so that it works properly with
	  CDS-only genes

2008-01-22 00:16  cjfields

	* [r14454] revert last commit; problem more serious than initially
	  appears (will require more debugging)

2008-01-21 23:57  cjfields

	* [r14453] get rid of annoying 'pseudohashes' error; tests now pass
	  on perl 5.8.8, perl 5.10

2008-01-21 22:41  cjfields

	* [r14452] Use db settings for both BioDBGFF and

	  drivers)

2008-01-17 19:26  cjfields

2007-12-03 23:37  jason

	* [r11788] actually parse percent similar numbers out properly, add
	  some tests to this effect, percent_conserved for nucleotide
	  alignments now represents ungapped numbers from FASTA/SSEARCH

2007-12-03 19:55  scain

	* [r11787] the check for '>' was actually swallowing the first line
	  of a fasta file (where the fasta file was masquerading as a GFF3
	  file without any features). Now that works.

2007-12-03 08:29  heikki

	* [r11786] correct syntax in the example; doc formatting

2007-11-29 22:54  cjfields

	  to calculate it here for all alns

2007-11-23 09:27  heikki

	* [r11771] no more hardcoded line length, default changed to 25
	  values, value for

2007-05-03 21:14  mcook

	* [r11426] redefine gff3_string to:
	  
	  # Return GFF3 format for the feature $self. Optionally
	  # $recurse to include GFF for any subfeatures of the feature. If
	  # recursing, provide special handling to "remove an extraneous
	  level
	  # of parentage" (unless $preserveHomegenousParent) for features
	  # which have at least one subfeature with the same type as the
	  # feature itself (thus redefining Lincoln's "homogenous
	  # parent/child" case, which previously required all children to
	  have
	  # the same type as parent). This usage is a convention for
	  # representing discontiguous features; they may be created by
	  using
	  # the -segment directive without specifying a distinct -subtype
	  to
	  # Bio::Graphics::FeatureBase->new (or to Bio::DB::SeqFeature,
	  # Bio::Graphics::Feature). Such homogenous subfeatures created in
	  # this fashion TYPICALLY do not have the parent (GFF column 9)
	  # attributes propogated to them; but, since they are all part of
	  the
	  # same parent, the ONLY difference relevant to GFF production
	  SHOULD
	  # be the $start and $end coordinates for their segment, and ALL
	  # THIER OTHER ATTRIBUTES should be taken from the parent
	  (including:
	  # score, Name, ID, Parent, etc), which happens UNLESS
	  # $dontPropogateParentAttrs is passed.
