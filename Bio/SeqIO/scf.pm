# _History_
#
# Ewan Birney <birney@sanger.ac.uk> developed the SeqIO 
# schema and the first prototype modules.
#
# This code is based on his Bio::SeqIO::Fasta module with
# the necessary minor tweaks necessary to get it to read
# and write raw formatted sequences made by
# chris dagdigian <dag@sonsorol.org>
#
# October 18, 1999 Largely rewritten by Lincoln Stein

=head1 NAME

Bio::SeqIO::scf - SCF sequence input/output stream

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Do not use this module directly.  Use it via the L<Bio::SeqIO> class.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object can transform Bio::Seq objects to and from SCF trace
files.
