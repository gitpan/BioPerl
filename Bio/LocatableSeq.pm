=head1 NAME

Bio::LocatableSeq - A Sequence object with start/end points on it

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Give standard usage here

=head1 DESCRIPTION


    # a normal sequence object
    $locseq->seq();
    $locseq->id();

    # has start,end points
    $locseq->start();
    $locseq->end();

    # inheriets off RangeI, so range operations possible

    $locseq->overlaps($seqfeature);

=head2 Mailing Lists


User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other
Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions preferably to one
of the Bioperl mailing lists.  Your participation is much appreciated.

The locatable sequence object was developed mainly because the 
SimpleAlign object requires this functionality, and in the rewrite
of the Sequence object we had to decide what to do with this.

It is, to be honest, not well integrated with the rest of bioperl, for
example, the trunc() function does not return a LocatableSeq object,
as some might have thought. There are all sorts of nasty gotcha's about
interactions between coordinate systems when these sort of objects are
used.
