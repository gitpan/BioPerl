Perl general comments:

	o Perl 5.00404 and lower often have problems with GDB.t

	o Perl on Digital Unix, WindowsNT, and MacOS has been reported
          to have problems with the Bio::DB::GDB on module (and
          consequently the test GDB.t). This is due to different
          versions of HTML::Parser.

	o DB.t has intermittent time-out failures (which will most
	  likely cause tests 3 and/or 27 to fail).

	o Index.t will fail if you have an out-of-date DBM file
	  installation.


Tested systems & OS Specific Comments or Warnings
==================================================

Machine : RedHat Linux 7.2 i686
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.004-5.6.1
Comments: XML::Writer tests fails (segfault), but do an install/force anyways
	  and all will work.

Machine : Linux i386
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.004-5.6.1
Comments: none

Machine : Digital Unix
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.004
Comments: Failure on GDB.t, possibly due to LWP cissues

Machine : OpenBSD 2.8 i386
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.6.0
Comments: none

Machine : Solaris 2.8 UltraSparc
Compiler: gcc
Perl    : 5.6.0
Comments: The t/flat.t test may report errors being unable to remove a temp directory, these can be safely ignored although an uncessary directory t/tmp may get created as result of this test.

Machine : FreeBSD 4.2 i386
Compiler: gcc
Perl    : 5.005_03
Comments: none

Machine : IRIX64 6.5 SGI
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.004_04
Comments: Some warnings about <HANDLE> which can be safely
	  ignored. Bio::DB::GenBank/GenPept cannot be used because
	  IO::String cannot be installed on 5.004.  Bio::DB::GDB will
	  not work on pre 5.005 versions of perl.

Machine : Win32, WinNT i386
Compiler: --
Perl    : ActiveState Perl 5.6, 5.5.1
Comments: Be sure that the module DB_File is installed and up-to-date 
	  to allow Bio::Index modules to work properly. 
          File::Temp potentially broken (causing at least BPpsilite to fail)
	  Installing ppm's IO-stringy and IO-String and File-Temp are 
	  necessary as well.
	  See http://bioperl.org/Core/windows-bioperl.html for more info on 
	  installing on Windows.

Comments: Issues and possible ways to fix them summarized by Todd Richmond
          on the bioperl.org Wiki.
