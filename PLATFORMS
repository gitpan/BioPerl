Perl general comments:

	o Perl 5.00404 and lower often have problems with GDB.t

	o Perl on Digital Unix, WindowsNT, and MacOS has been reported
          to have problems with the Bio::DB::GDB on module (and
          consequently the test GDB.t). This is due to different
          versions of HTML::Parser.

	o DB.t has intermittent time-out failures (which will most
	  likely cause tests 3 and/or 27 to fail).

	o Index.t will fail if you have an out-of-date DBM file
	  installation.

	o On some machines (IRIX, OSF) there can be a shell buffer 
	  overrun which will not allow the makefile to work.  This is
	  due to a limitation in the makefile generated by the
	  ExtUtils::MakeMaker module.  The best course of action is to
	  installed the latest ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  You will likely
	  still see a problem with make test, but you should still be
	  able to issue a make install.


Tested systems & OS Specific Comments or Warnings
==================================================

Machine : RedHat Linux 7.2 i686
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.004-5.6.1
Comments: XML::Writer tests fails (segfault), but do an install/force anyways
	  and all will work.

Machine : Linux i386
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.004-5.6.1
Comments: none

Machine : Digital Unix
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.004
Comments: Failure on GDB.t, possibly due to LWP cissues

Machine : OpenBSD 2.8 i386
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.6.0
Comments: none

Machine : Solaris 2.8 UltraSparc
Compiler: gcc
Perl    : 5.6.0
Comments: The t/flat.t test may report errors being unable to remove 
	  a temp directory, these can be safely ignored although an 
	  uncessary directory t/tmp may get created as result of this test.

Machine : FreeBSD 4.2 i386
Compiler: gcc
Perl    : 5.005_03
Comments: none

Machine : IRIX64 6.5 SGI
Compiler: cc
Perl    : 5.004_04
Comments: Some warnings about <HANDLE> which can be safely
	  ignored. Bio::DB::GenBank/GenPept cannot be used because
	  IO::String cannot be installed on 5.004.  Bio::DB::GDB will
	  not work on pre 5.005 versions of perl.

          See notes at the top about problem with makefiles generated
          and limited buffer size on typical IRIX boxes.
  
Machine : Win32, WinNT i386
Compiler: --
Perl    : ActiveState Perl 5.6, 5.5.1
Comments: Be sure that the module DB_File is installed and up-to-date 
	  to allow Bio::Index modules to work properly. 
          File::Temp potentially broken (causing at least BPpsilite to fail)
	  Installing ppm's IO-stringy and IO-String and File-Temp are 
	  necessary as well.
	  See http://bioperl.org/Core/windows-bioperl.html for more info on 
	  installing on Windows.
	
Machine : MacOS
Compiler: --
Perl    : MacPerl
Comments: Issues and possible ways to fix them summarized by Todd Richmond
          on the bioperl.org Wiki.


Machine : MacOS X
Compiler: gcc
Perl    : 5.6.0
Comments: Steve Cannon has made available Bioperl OS X installation
	  directions and notes online at the following URL:

Machine : HP-UX / PA-RISC 11.0
Compiler: gcc
Perl    : 5.6.1
Comments: Tested by (dag@sonsorol.org) on a barebones 8-cpu system without the
          various dependencies installed. All tests pass except those
          skipped by the test harness due to missing external packages. Thanks
          due to HP for providing the OBF with an Itanium workstation plus
          internet access to other HP test platforms. Feedback from HP-UX users
          is appreciated.


Machine : HP-UX / Itanium ('ia64') 11.0
Compiler: gcc
Perl    : 5.6.1
Comments: Tested by (dag@sonsorol.org) on a barebones 4-cpu system without the
          various dependencies installed. 96% of the tests pass; OBF is 
          working on getting 100% pass rate. Thanks due to HP for providing 
          the OBF with an Itanium workstation plus internet access to other 
          HP test platforms. Feedback from HP-UX users is appreciated.
